{"name":"CHENG YIFAN","tagline":"Projects Demonstration","body":"### Hasbro Game Channel 2014.05 - 2014.09\r\nUbisoft Entertainment was cooperating with Hasbro Company to work out the game platform on XBOX ONE and PS4, which involves the classic board games, such as Monopoly, Risk, Scrabble etc. \r\nMy job was working with UI designer to develop the features on client side by web technology, like HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS and Jquery. This product has been released in September 2014. We ensured the platform was released on time even the design had changed several times. I have completed a couple of essential features in this project, such as achievements, friends etc.\r\nHere is a [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCzTrXI0un0 \"Hasbro Game Channel Trailer\").\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
