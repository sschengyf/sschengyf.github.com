The official website adopted PHP, MySQL and Linux, Apache as the backend side, and Smarty, CSS, jQuery assembled the front-end client. \r\n\r\nI played a key role in this project.

The operation team was satisfied with my work, this website attracted over 60,000 players to register and join the technical beta test before I left this project.\r\n\r\n[End War Online]: http://ewo.ubi.com\r\n\r\n*\tHome page screenshot\r\n![End War Online Home Page Screenshot](./img/ewo_home.png)\r\n\r\n*\tBackend tools for the website\r\n![End War Online Backend tools Screenshot](./img/ewo_backend.png)\r\n\r\n---","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
